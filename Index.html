      What is Lorem Ipsum?
      <br>
      <br>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
